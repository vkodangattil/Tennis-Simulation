# Tennis-Simulation
The goal of this project is to allow the user to choose two proffessional tennis players from a given list of 31 players, and perform an accurate simulation of a match between them. This is done by first webscraping data from https://www.atptour.com/en/stats/leaderboard?boardType=serve&timeFrame=52Week&surface=all&versusRank=all&formerNo1=false and https://www.ultimatetennisstatistics.com/statsLeaders. The retrieved data is then inserted into a MySQL database. The user then selects the two players for the match simulation. The database is then used to calculate the probability that each respective player wins a point. This is done using Stephen R. Clarke and Tristan Barnett model for combining player statistics to predict the outcome of a tennis match. In order to run this code, you will need to install Python's Anaconda distrubtion and a webdriver.
